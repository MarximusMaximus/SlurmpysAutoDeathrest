Temporary version?

This mod forces pawns to auto-deathrest when it hits a defined threshold.

The threshold can be edited in the mod settings.

This is my first mod ever for RimWorld. It shouldn't have any incompatibilities but if you find any errors/bugs/incompatibilities please let me know.

Changes to OG:
Recompiled/repackaged for 1.5. (If the OG updates, let me know so I can remove this one.)
Modified solution file for easier maintenance of other files.
git-ified the project
